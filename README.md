# Beat 

This is just a simple website ( that I wrote because I was bored at lectures ) with a spinning wheel you can put text on and draw a random selection from. To spin the wheel you have to click on it.

Written entirely in JS with the help of the SVG.js library.

Props to you if you get the reference.
